BUSINESS
The Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services in order to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand. This requires timely and successful development, market acceptance, and effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels. The Company relies on outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia for component and product manufacturing and logistical services, and transportation and logistics management. Changes or additions to the supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties. The Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks due to single-source outsourcing partners, and industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. Global or regional economic conditions can also affect the Company's ability to obtain components.

RISK FACTORS

The Company is a global business with the majority of its net sales coming from outside the U.S. It faces intense competition from companies with established service offerings, those offering content for free, and illegitimate means to obtain digital content and applications. The Company must continually introduce new products and services, manage frequent transitions, and obtain components from single or limited sources. It relies on outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia for manufacturing and logistics, and is exposed to supply and pricing risks, as well as quality and design defects. It produces and distributes digital content and products, such as its devices, operating systems, and applications, through the App Store, and retains a commission from sales of applications and digital services or goods within an application. The Company is subject to a variety of laws, regulations, and other obligations regarding data protection, environmental, social, and governance considerations, legal proceedings, and antitrust investigations. It is also exposed to information technology system failures and network disruptions, malicious attacks, and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems. The Company's success and profitability are subject to product pricing pressures, increased competition, supply shortages, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, credit risk, changes in tax rates, and stock price volatility.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT COMMON EQUITY


MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION

The Company had a successful fiscal year in 2022, with total net sales increasing 8% or $28.5 billion compared to 2021. This was driven primarily by higher net sales of iPhone, Services and Mac, despite the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. During 2022, the Company announced several new product, service and software offerings, including updated MacBook Pro and MacBook Air models, updated iPhone SE and iPad Air with 5G technology, and Apple Pay Later. The Company also increased its Program authorization from $315 billion to $405 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.22 to $0.23 per share.

Net sales by category for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows: Products net sales increased due to a different product mix and higher volume, while Services net sales increased due to higher net sales from advertising, cloud services and the App Store. Net sales by reportable segment for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows: Americas net sales increased due to higher net sales of iPhone, Services and Mac; Europe net sales increased due to higher net sales of iPhone and Services; Greater China net sales increased due to higher net sales of iPhone and Services; Japan net sales decreased due to the weakness of the yen relative to the U.S. dollar; and Rest of Asia Pacific net sales increased due to higher net sales of iPhone, Mac and Services.

Gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows: Products gross margin increased due to a different product mix and higher volume, while Services gross margin increased due to higher Services net sales. Operating expenses for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows: R&D expense increased due to increases in headcount-related expenses and engineering program costs, while selling, general and administrative expense increased due to increases in headcount-related expenses, advertising and professional services. Other income/(expense), net decreased due to higher realized losses on debt securities, unfavorable fair value adjustments on equity securities and higher interest expense.

The Company had a balance of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities of $156.4 billion as of September 24, 2022, and had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $111.8 billion, with $11.1 billion payable within 12 months. The Company also had $10.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months, and had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.3 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months. The Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $71.1 billion, with $68.4 billion payable within 12 months, and had other purchase obligations of $17.8 billion, with $6.8 billion payable within 12 months. The balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was $22.0 billion, with $5.3 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. The Company's quarterly cash dividend was $0.23 per share, and the Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis.

MARKET RISK DISCLOSURES

The Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions, interest rate swaps, and underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures to manage its financial risk. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company’s debt. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities to minimize the potential risk of principal loss and has entered into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a $4.0 billion and $4.1 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, respectively. The Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar and may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to protect against foreign exchange risks. The Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $1.0 billion as of September 24, 2022, compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $550 million as of September 25, 2021.

Products gross margin increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due to a different product mix and higher product volume, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Services gross margin increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Operating expenses for 2022 increased year-over-year due to increases in headcount-related expenses and engineering program costs. Other income/(expense), net decreased during 2022 compared to 2021 due to higher realized losses on debt securities, unfavorable fair value adjustments on equity securities and higher interest expense, partially offset by higher foreign exchange gains. The Company's effective tax rate for 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation and the impact of the U.S. federal R&D credit. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $111.8 billion, with $11.1 billion payable within 12 months.

MARKET RISK DISCLOSURES
The company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions, as well as interest rate swaps, to manage its foreign currency and interest rate exposures. However, there is no guarantee that these positions will fully offset the financial impact of movements in foreign exchange or interest rates. The recognition of gains and losses related to these instruments may not align with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures, which could negatively affect the company's financial condition and operating results. The company's exposure to interest rate changes primarily relates to its investment portfolio and outstanding debt, with a focus on preserving capital and supporting liquidity requirements. The company typically invests in highly rated securities to minimize the risk of principal loss and limits credit exposure to any one issuer. A sensitivity analysis shows that a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decline in the fair market value of the investment portfolio. The company uses interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Changes in exchange rates, particularly a strengthening of the US dollar, can negatively impact the company's net sales and gross margins. The company may enter into foreign currency contracts to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with assets, liabilities, transactions, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. A sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk model estimates the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on the company's foreign currency derivative positions. The company estimates a maximum one-day loss in fair value based on this model. However, actual future gains and losses may differ from the sensitivity analyses due to the inherent limitations of predicting changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and the company's actual exposures and positions.
