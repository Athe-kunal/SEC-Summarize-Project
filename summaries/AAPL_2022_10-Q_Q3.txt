CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
The Company's management has evaluated and concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. These controls and procedures ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the specified time periods. The evaluation also found no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the first quarter of 2023 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Epic Games filed a lawsuit against the Company, alleging antitrust violations and unfair competition related to the operation of the Company's App Store. The Company counterclaimed for breach of contract. The Northern California District Court ruled in favor of the Company on nine out of ten counts and also found that certain provisions of the App Store Review Guidelines violated California's unfair competition law. An injunction was issued. Epic appealed the decision, and the Company filed a cross-appeal and obtained a stay pending the appeal. The Company has other unresolved legal proceedings and claims. Certain matters were settled in the first quarter of 2023, but they did not have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is uncertain, and if legal matters are resolved against the Company for amounts exceeding management's expectations, it could have a materially adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and operating results.

RISK FACTORS
The Company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price are subject to various known and unknown factors, as outlined in the 2022 Form 10-K under "Risk Factors." These risks, when realized, can have a significant negative impact on the Company. There have been no significant changes to the risk factors since the 2022 Form 10-K.
