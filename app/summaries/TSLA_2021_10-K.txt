BUSINESS

Tesla is a company focused on accelerating the world's transition to sustainable energy. It designs, manufactures, sells and leases high-performance fully electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems, as well as offering services related to their products. It has two reportable segments: automotive and energy generation and storage. Tesla has several electric vehicles, including Model 3, Model Y, Model S and Model X, as well as planned electric vehicles such as Cybertruck and the new Tesla Roadster. They also have energy storage products such as Powerwall and Megapack, and solar energy systems such as Solar Roof. They offer warranties and performance guarantees for their products, as well as leasing and loan financing arrangements, and insurance products. Tesla has 99,290 full-time employees worldwide and is subject to various U.S. and international regulations. It competes in the automotive market based on traditional segment classification and propulsion technology, and in the energy storage market based on price, energy density and efficiency. It is also focused on protecting its intellectual property rights.

RISK FACTORS

Tesla is a manufacturing company that produces vehicles and energy storage products. It is exposed to a variety of risks, including increased debt, currency exchange rate fluctuations, intellectual property infringement claims, changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to ESG practices, events outside of its control, reduced government and economic incentives, evolving laws and regulations, and failure to comply with privacy and consumer protection laws. The global COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on Tesla's business, including the temporary suspension of operations at its manufacturing facilities worldwide, employee furloughs and compensation reductions, and delays in product deliveries and deployments. Tesla must manage its growth effectively, compete with other types of alternative fuel vehicles, and manage its suppliers to ensure they deliver components according to schedules, prices, quality and volumes that are acceptable to Tesla. It must also maintain public credibility and confidence in its long-term business prospects, manage the risks associated with recruiting and retaining key personnel, and obtain stockholder approval for future increases to the number of awards available under its equity incentive and employee stock purchase plans. Tesla has $5.38 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness, and its ability to make payments on this debt depends on its future performance.
