MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION

Apple Inc. and its subsidiaries released several new products in the first quarter of 2022, resulting in an 11% year-over-year increase in net sales. This growth was driven by iPhone, Services, and Mac. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition. Products gross margin and Services gross margin increased due to a different product mix and strength in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Operating expenses increased due to higher headcount-related expenses, engineering program costs, and infrastructure-related costs. Other income/(expense), net decreased due to higher net losses on marketable and non-marketable securities and lower interest income. The Company's effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and tax benefits from share-based compensation. The Company has a wide variety of individual suppliers and outsourcing partners, and as of December 25, 2021, had manufacturing purchase obligations of $47.6 billion, with $47.5 billion payable within 12 months. The Company also has a capital return program authorized by the Board of Directors, which includes a share repurchase program and a quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis.

MARKET RISK DISCLOSURES

The Company has not experienced any significant changes to its market risk during the first three months of 2022. For more detailed information on the Company's exposure to market risk, readers should refer to the market risk disclosures in the 2021 Form 10-K.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
The Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 25, 2021 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the specified time periods. There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the first quarter of 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Epic Games, Inc. filed a lawsuit against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law. The Company filed a counterclaim for breach of contract and the Northern California District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts and issued an injunction. Epic appealed the decision and the Company filed a cross-appeal and was granted a stay pending the appeal. The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and settled certain matters during the first quarter of 2022 that did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is uncertain and if one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.

RISK FACTORS
The Company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, both known and unknown. These risks are outlined in the 2021 Form 10-K under the heading "Risk Factors". If any of these risks materialize, the Company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price can be adversely affected. There have been no material changes to the Company's risk factors since the 2021 Form 10-K.

USE OF PROCEEDS
The Company was authorized to purchase up to $315 billion of its common stock under the Program announced on April 28, 2021, of which $274.5 billion had been utilized as of December 25, 2021.
